## 🛡️ Focus Areas

- **DDoS Attacks**
  - Study of volumetric, protocol-based, and application-layer attacks
  - Analysis of attack patterns and vectors used by modern botnets

- **Defensive Techniques**
  - Traditional countermeasures like rate limiting, IP blacklisting, and traffic filtering
  - Exploration of cloud-based and hybrid mitigation strategies

- **AI-Powered Mitigation**
  - Research on how Machine Learning can detect and classify DDoS attacks in real time
  - Experimenting with anomaly detection, supervised learning models, and traffic analysis
  - Investigating ways to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy

---

## 🧠 Ongoing Research

Currently involved in academic research focused on:
- The **application of Artificial Intelligence in the mitigation of DDoS attacks**
- Creating intelligent systems capable of **learning attack behaviors** and adapting defenses dynamically

This includes:
- Dataset analysis and preprocessing (e.g., CICIDS, NSL-KDD)
- Building classification models to differentiate normal and malicious traffic
- Evaluating the trade-off between detection performance and computational cost

## 🚀 Learning & Development

- Deepening my knowledge in:
  - **Cybersecurity**
  - **Computer Networks**
  - **Machine Learning**
  - **Python for security tools and AI models**

- Always looking to collaborate on open-source projects, research papers, or proof-of-concept tools in the field of **network defense**.
